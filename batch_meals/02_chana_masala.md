# Chana Masala

An bona fide Indian classic. Typically eaten with a chapati or some naan bread, so have this ready to go for eating time.

Serves 8 \| 40 mins

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp cooking oil (I use olive)
- 3 onions
- 4 tins chickpeas
- 2 tins chopped tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato puree

#### Aromatics
- ~8cm piece of ginger
- 3 fresh green chillis
- 6 garlic cloves

#### Spices
- 2 tsp garam masala
- 1 tbsp cumin seeds
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp chilli powder

## Method

1. Get all your aromatics roughly chopped and smash to a paste in a pestle and mortar.
1. Get a large pan (this is going to need to hold everything) on a medium heat, while its heating slice your **onions** and add to the pan. Fry until they are nice and brown - around 10 minutes.
1. Once this is done add the **aromatic paste** and stir in, before adding the **chickpeas, tinned tomatoes and tomato puree**. Bring to a simmer and cook for around 10 minutes until the sauce has thickened.
1. While the sauce is cooking you can measure out the **spices**, and when it's thickened you can add them. Stir in and add as much water as you need to get the consistency you want. Cook for another 5 minutes or so.
