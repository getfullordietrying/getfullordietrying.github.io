# Massaman curry

Serves 4-6 \| 40-60 mins 

## Ingredients

#### Rice

- 200g brown rice

#### Protein

- 650g chicken thighs (skin on or off, bone in or out, whatever you can get)
**OR**
- A big block of firm tofu (around 400g or so)
- cornflour

#### Curry

- 2 tbsp cooking oil (I use olive)
- 1 onion
- 5 garlic cloves
- thumb sized chunk of garlic
- 60g red curry paste
- 1 tsp ground coriander (or preferably bash up some seed)
- 1/2 tsp turmeric 
- 3 star anise
- 2 kaffir lime leaves (optional)
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 can coconut milk (full fat, reduced fat is shit and won't help you lose weight)
- 500g potatoes
- 80g roasted unsalted peanuts (or unroasted and dry fry them for a bit)
- 1-2 tbsp fish sauce
- juice of 1/2 - 1 lime
- 1-3 birds eye chillis
- sugar

## Method

1. First thing to do is get your aromatics cooking, so start heating a Dutch oven or similar on a medium heat with the oil and then finely dice your **onions**, crush the **garlic** and either finely grate (microplane is good here) or finely dice the **ginger**. By the time you've done that the pan is probably hot, so you can get them in the pan and sweat them for around 5 minutes.
1. The next thing you'll need to do is prep the rest of the curry sauce. Bash up the **lemongrass** and tie it in a knot. Measure out the **red curry paste**, **coriander** and **turmeric** in a bowl.
1. When the aromatics are sufficiently sweated add the **contents of your bowl**, and mix up in the pan. Then chuck in all the other good stuff: **lemongrass**, **star anise**, **lime leaves**, **cinnamon** and **coconut milk**. Finally refill the **coconut milk** can with water and the **water** (not the can) to the pan too.
1. While this is warming up you can prep your protein. Depending on what your using, either cut up your **chicken** into chunks (you can chuck the skin in the mix too if you like), or dice and then dry your **tofu** and coat with cornflour and seasoning.
1. If you're using the **tofu** get a frying pan on a high heat with some oil and fry off the tofu until it is crispy (around 10-15 mins).
1. This is a good time to start cooking your rice.
1. Once your protein is prepared chuck it in the Dutch oven. If you're using tofu chuck the potatoes and peanuts in now too, otherwise wait 20 mins to do this while the chicken cooks. The sauce will need a bit of thickening so leave the lid off for at least 20 mins or so and simmer away.
1. Add the fish sauce, lime and sugar and chillis to taste.
1. Serve with the cooked rice.
