- Thumb sized bit of ginger
- 4 garlic cloves
    
## Method

1. Get your **rice** on, this will take the most time to cook.
1. As soon as you have done that, start prepping your other ingredients:
    - Top and tail the **green beans** (you can go to step 3. once this is done if you're in a hurry)
    - Mix all the **sauce ingredients** in a small bowl, ensure sugar is fully disolved.
    - Mince the **ginger and garlic** (Microplane is good for this)
    - Cut your **dried chilis** into three
1. Get a large frying pan heated up nice and hot with the **oil**. Add the **green beans** and cook for around 10-15 mins until they are nice and brown. Finish prepping your other ingredients while this is happening. Once the beans are cooked set them aside.
1. Add some more **oil** to the pan and add the **peppercorns**, set aside when they are brown.
1. Add the **pork** and cook until brown, then add the **chilis, garlic, ginger** and fry for 30 seconds or so.
1. Finally chuck the **beans** and **peppercorns** in again with the **sauce** and cook for a couple more mins until the sauce has mostly been absorbed. 
1. Your **rice** is probably done by now so get it drained and plate everything up.
