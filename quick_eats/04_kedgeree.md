# Kedgeree

Serves 3 \| 30 mins \| 2 pans

## Ingredients 

#### Fish

- 240g smoked haddock

#### Rice

- olive oil
- 150g white basmati rice
- 1 medium onion
- 3 tsp curry powder
- 1 bay leaf

#### To serve

- butter
- 3 eggs
- parsley
- lemon slices
- mango chutney

## Method

1. Rinse your rice well.
1. In a saucepan pour boiling water (at least 500ml) over the **smoked haddock** and heat on low for around 10 minutes until cooked. Try not to boil the water to better cook the haddock. When done remove gently from the pan and allow to cool.
1. While the haddock is cooking finely dice your **onion** and heat a large frying pan with some olive oil over a medium heat. Add the onions and brown lightly. Then, stir in the **rice** and when it turns translucent, add the **curry powder**. Cook for around 30 seconds - 1 minute.
1. Ideally you will time this so that the haddock is cooked by now. Add around 500ml of the water the haddock cooked in to the rice with the **bay leaf** and simmer until the rice is tender and all the liquid is absorbed, around 10 - 15 mins.
1. While the rice is cooking, wash your saucepan and then boil the **eggs**. Bring the water to the boil with the eggs in and when boiling start a 6 minute timer. When it buzzes, take the eggs out, rinse under cold water, peel and quarter.
1. Finely cut the **parsley** and when the rice is done, mix in the **haddock**, **parsley** and a good knob of **butter** so the kedgeree looks juicy af.
1. Plate up, or turn into a hot serving dish and arrange the **egg** slices on top. Serve with **lemon** slices and **mango chutney**
