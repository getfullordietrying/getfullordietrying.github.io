# Pad Thai

Serves 2

20-30 mins start to finish 

## Ingredients 

- 125g brown rice Thai noodles
- Olive oil or any other relatively plain cooking oil
- 280g tofu hard (this is quite a lot of tofu, you can use less if you want)
- Some cornflour to coat the tofu
- salt
- 2 eggs
- 2 garlic cloves
- 20g tamarind paste
- 30g brown sugar
- 25g fish sauce
- 15g oyster sauce
- 80g peanuts
- Lime wedges
- Coriander
- 2 spring onions
- Birds eye chilies 

## Method

1. Cover noodles in boiled water and leave for 10 mins, meanwhile crack on with the next steps. When the 10 mins is up drain the noodles and rinse in cold water. 

2. Prep ingredients for cooking you will need at least 3 bowls for this bit:
	- Cut tofu into blocks and dry any liquid off with a towel. Put in a bowl and coat with cornflour and salt
	- Cut peanuts into chunks
	- Slice limes into wedges
	- Slice spring onions and coriander
	- Slice birds eye chilies if using
	- Crush garlic
	- Crack eggs into a bowl and whisk
	- Mix all the sauce ingredients in a bowl

3. Heat up olive oil in a large frying pan on a medium high heat (6. on induction). When it's hot add the tofu and start frying. After about 8 mins should be fairly browned. At this point add the garlic and cook for another minute or so.
4. Move the tofu and garlic to one half of the pand, scramble the eggsin the other half. Once it's scrambled add the peanuts then the noodles, then the sauce and mix.  Heat this all through for a couple of mins. At the last minute add most of the spring onions and coriander.
5. Plate up in pasta bowls. Give everyone some lime wedges, and top the noodles with the left over spring onions, coriander and optional chilies.
