# Tuna rice salad

Serves 2 \| 30 mins max \| 1 pan 

## Ingredients

- 100g brown rice
- 1 tin of tuna
- 1/2 cucumber
- 1 red onion
- 2 sticks of celery
- 2tbsp capers
- handful of parsley

#### Dressing
- 50ml extra virgin olive oil
- 25ml lemon juice (~1/2 lemon)
- pinch of mustard powder
- 1 clove of garlic
- salt and pepper


## Method

1. This is super quick if you get in the habit of cooking big batches of rice and keeping it in the fridge (on the downside you might get food poisoning, what's your risk tolerance like?). If you don't, get your **rice** on, this will take the most time to cook.
1. As soon as you have done that, start prepping your other ingredients:
    - Dice the **cucumber**
    - Dice the **red onion**
    - Dice the **celery** 
    - Finely chop the **parsley**.
    - Mix all the **dressing ingredients** in a jar and give a good shake.
1. Drain the **tuna** and add to a bowl with the **cucumber, onion, celery, capers and parsley**.
1. Add the rice when it's done (if you are cooking from fresh you should run under the cold tap to cool) and mix well.
1. Add the **dressing** and enjoy!
