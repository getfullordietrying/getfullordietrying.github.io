# Introduction

This is an online book of recipes that, as well as not containing any ads or long boring stories for search engine optimisation purposes, are all delicious (to me).

The book is split up into four sections, which you can access from the hamburger menu if you're on a phone, these are:

1. **Quick eats**: these are your classic mid-week dinners. They should take less than 30mins to cook from start to finish. I also indicate the number of pans they require to cook as washing up does unfortunately still exist.
1. **Batch Meals**: these are meals that you can cook a massive batch of and portion out for eating later on. They will reheat and freeze well. They may take a while to cook, but think of it as a good investment for later.
1. **Bangers**: these are meals that I like to cook for other people because they are absolutely banging so they will know that I'm a really good cook. They might take a while to cook, be a bit more difficult or involved, or use more expensive ingredients than recipes in the other sections, but the results are well worth the extra care, time and money.
1. **Assortments**: other recipes that are worth recording, but don't fit into any of the other categories. 

The instructions are written as a comprehensive list of the steps you will need to take with all of the ingredients that you will need to use. I do get a bit annoyed by recipes that say things like "serve with rice" at the end with no previous warning that rice might be required. I also include how to prepare all of the ingredients in the instructions rather than in the list of ingredients which seems to be the standard elsewhere. This is because often it's much quicker to prepare ingredients as you go, in the downtime while waiting for things to cook, rather than doing it all at the start like a n00b.

Quantities in cooking are a funny thing. Sometimes it doesn't really matter if you add half or double the amount the recipe says, other times it will make the food completely inedible (especially with really salty ingredients like oyster, soy or fish sauce). When the quantities are important then they will be given precisely. When they aren't important I will either say so, give them imprecisely (you really don't need to compare the piece of ginger to your thumb), or just leave the quantity blank and let you decide using your common sense. 

There are no photos, so if you want to see what the meal might look like then try typing the recipe name into Google Image search.
